# functions
useful functions
These are basic python functions that have been useful to me as a data analyst
I prefer to work in notebooks using jupyter and python and I generally find myself re-using these functions
all you need to do is import the file just like any other library into your notebook and you can call the functions
keeps username and passwords for connecting to databases out of your ntoebook as well
